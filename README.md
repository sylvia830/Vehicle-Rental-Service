# Vehicle-Rental-Service
A full database web application using PHP, HTML, CSS and Oracle database system that models the functionalities of a vehicle rental service company

It is a group project for one of the Comp Sci courses at UBC (CPSC304: database management). 

We made this project in 3 days. There's a lot of room to improve on the GUI and the actual functionalities. 

The objective of this project was to write queries that perform certain tasks(select, delete, update, aggregation, nested aggregation, and division, projection, join, etc.)
